Task:
You will often need to use branching code.
To do that, you will need 'if' statement.
Create a program that reads a value into a variable, and if its
greater than 10, the program must print out 'Success'.
Don't forget: in «Python», to make the program 'understand' that code block
relates to the 'if' statement, the next line must have a tabulation(empty space)
♪
a =♪ int(♪input()♪)
if♪ a > 10♪:
	♪ print('♪Success'♪)
